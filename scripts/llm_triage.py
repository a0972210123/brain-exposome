"""Optional LLM relevance-triage for the literature radar — 3-provider fallback.

Ported from the owner's dreamcatcher `ai-worker` (tela-aurea-ai-worker): the same
resilient chain **NVIDIA NIM → Groq → Cloudflare → (fail-open)**, the same env-var
names, the same robust JSON parsing. Here it scores whether a paper could UPDATE a
figure the brain-exposome map uses, instead of writing a healing message.

Stdlib only (urllib) — no pip in CI. **Fail-open**: if no keys are set, or every
tier errors, `triage()` returns None and the caller keeps the candidate. So the
literature radar always produces output; the LLM only *ranks/filters* it.

**Model ids are not pinned.** They rot on the provider's schedule, silently: Groq
retired every Llama in 2026-08, so the id this file used to hardcode
(`llama-3.1-8b-instant`) now 404s. In a monthly cron that fails open nobody would
have noticed — the report would still have said "LLM-triaged" while filtering
nothing. So each tier asks its provider what it serves *today*, and the verdict
carries the model that produced it so the report can name it.

Env (copy from the dreamcatcher .env; set as GitHub Actions secrets):
  NVIDIA_API_KEY            tier 1 (NIM)     + optional NIM_MODEL
  GROQ_API_KEY             tier 2 (Groq)    + optional GROQ_MODEL   (GroqCloud_API_KEY also accepted)
  CF_ACCOUNT_ID + CF_API_TOKEN   tier 3 (Cloudflare Workers AI via REST) + optional CF_AI_MODEL
The optional *_MODEL vars pin one id and skip discovery — for reproducing an old
run, not as the normal path.

      cf   — ~26 ids, already filtered to Text Generation server-side, so the
             exclusion problem mostly disappears there.

    The task is small: one abstract in, {"verdict","reason"} out. It is not
    cheap in tokens, though — everything Groq still serves reasons first, so the
